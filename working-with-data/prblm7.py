#Python has built-in functions min and max to compute minimum and maximum of a given list. Provide an implementation for these functions.
#What happens when you call your min and max functions with a list of strings

list=["apple","banana","kiwi"]
print(max(list))   #here maximum in list is kiwi because it follow dictonary order and give max string that
                    #means in dictonary 'k' is after  a and b
print(min(list)) # in case of min its also follow dictonary order and give min result from list here apple is answer
                 #because a is letter that comes before b and k
